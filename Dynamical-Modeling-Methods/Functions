Fluo-3

To a first approximation, one can assume that the dye used in this experiment, fluo-3, only emits fluorescence when it is bound to Ca2+.
Thus, where KD is the dissociation constant of the dye, and [Fluo3]TOTAL is the dye concentration, fluorescence is proportional to:


F~{[Ca2+][Fluo3]TOTAL[Ca2+]+KD}

If one makes a reasonable assumption for baseline [Ca2+] (e.g. 100 nm), the following equation can be used to convert from a ratio R 
(units of F/F0) to [Ca2+] in units of concentration:

[Ca2+]={RKDKD[Ca2+]baselineâˆ’R+1
Implement this equation to convert flash and noflash from units of F/F0 to units of [Ca2+], in nM.


You can assume [Ca2+]baseline= 100 nM, and KD= 700 nM. Keep in mind that your variables flash and noflash are not just scalars (numbers)
but are defined at many time points.
